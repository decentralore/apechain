# How to go from Coinbase to ApeChain
Quick write up on how to move money from your debit card (or bank account) to ApeChain in a few minutes. I'm going to cover a few different methods.
- [Base](#home-base)
- [Arbitrum](#arbitrum-ape)

## Home Base
- Open the Coinbase app on your mobile device
- Navigate to the `Explore` tab in the lower right hand corner

- Find Ethereum under `Top Assets` and select it to open up the asset page
- Tap the `Transfer` button in the lower right hand corner
- Tap the `Send` button
- Select the Base network (which allows for free withdrawals)
    - Select `Yes, it's supported`
- Copy the wallet address you want to use on ApeChain
    - Whatever app works for transferring the wallet address from desktop to mobile
- Paste the wallet address from clipboard into the Coinbase app
- Enter the amount of USD you want to send
- Tap the `Preview` button

### Purchase ETH
- You'll need to top up so tap the `Buy ETH` button
- Select the appropriate payment method
    - For speed, use the debit card option
    - **NOTE:** Personally, ACH transfers have worked but Coinbase advises against it if you want instant withdrawals

- Tap the `Buy Now` button
- Make note of the price and fees of the purchase
- Wait for pending order, typically email confirmation within a few minutes

### Transfer ETH to Base
- Attempt to transfer the ETH to your wallet again
- Navigate back through Explore > Ethereum > Transfer > Send
- Select the Base network (which allows for free withdrawals)
    - Select `Yes, it's supported`
- Copy the wallet address you want to use on ApeChain
- Paste the wallet address from clipboard into the Coinbase app
- Triple check the wallet address
- Send the max amount of ETH available

### Resorvoir Relay
*Note: These steps are written for desktop but it's possible to complete them on mobile*
- Open the Relay Bridge to ApeChain
    - https://relay.link/bridge/ape
- Select `Connect Wallet`
    - Connect your wallet to relay.link
- Select `ETH` in the lower right hand side of the `From` token
    - Select `Base`
    - Find and select your Base `Ether`
- `Ape Chain` and `APE` should auto populate in the `To` field
- Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge
    - NOTE: Make sure to [leave enough ETH behind](#additional-notes) for gas fees
        - On Base `$1.00` worth of ETH should allow for quite a few basic transactions
        - At the time of writing a dollar is around 0.0005 ETH
- Select the `Trade` button
- Review the bridge transaction details
    - Aim for `Price Impact` to be less than 2%
    - `From address` and `To address` should be the same - your address
- Confirm the trade^

    - *ADVANCED:* Set a `Custom` `Gas Price (Gwei)` and `Max Priority Fee` if time is **not** of the essence

            - https://dune.com/payton/base-l2-gas-price-tracker
        - `Max Priority Fee` of 1.5 Gwei typically works - use a higher value if any doubts
        - **WARNING:** You only have 30 minutes to get most DEX transactions to confirm _(Relay included)_
- `Sign` and `Confirm` the transaction
- After a few moments you should see `Successfully swapped`
